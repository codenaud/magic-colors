## Description

This project is a JavaScript practice focused on DOM manipulation and event handling. It features a 400x400-pixel panel containing a grid of squares. When a user hovers their mouse cursor over a square, it dynamically changes to a random color with a smooth transition. As the user moves to another square, the previous color gradually fades away, creating a visually engaging experience.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a playful and interactive way to explore the power of JavaScript in manipulating web elements. The dynamic color changes and transitions add an exciting visual aspect, making it an ideal platform for experimenting and learning more about JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript or an experienced developer seeking to create visually appealing web interactions, this project offers a great starting point for exploration. The possibilities are endless, and you can take this concept even further by adding new features and interactions.
